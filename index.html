      <p>It is 100% true that no solution is perfect. However, the sacrifices of iron fertilization can save our planet. As you have learned it is very cheap and one small amount of iron can produce and protect a large amount of phytoplankton. It is not only an inexpensive process but a very effective one. It does not have many negative aspects and clearly, the positives outweigh the negatives. In fact, it is a world that needs to act now because we cannot save the ocean and the quarter-million species with it at the last minute. As we have learned from previous generations, (and from school work) putting anything off to the last minute can be hard to fix. While we still need to protect our land and forest, we need to pay attention to our ocean too. What makes ocean seeding so special is that it tackles multiple problems at once: marine extinction and global warming. So far we can do iron fertilization. After Researching this problem I was able to come to the conclusion that it is important for scientists that work what's the ocean to understand that the ocean is in Desperate help and iron fertilization is the cure hopefully with my website I can catch the attention of marine scientists and  other scientists around the world to save our ocean before it is too late. Iron fertilization for such an important message of keeping the ocean clean is one of the cheapest methods that are still effective. It can help all Five oceans on their planet. and with the technology we have now you can definitely act as soon as possible iron fertilization has been studied for almost a decade and we need to be open to this solution. </p>

          <h2 style=color:black>SDG 14.5</h2>
          <p>The expansion of protected areas for marine biodiversity and existing policies and treaties that encourage responsible use of ocean resources are still insufficient to combat the adverse effects of overfishing, growing ocean acidification due to climate change and worsening coastal eutrophication. As billions of people depend on oceans for their livelihood and food source and on the transboundary nature of oceans, increased efforts and interventions are needed to conserve and sustainably use ocean resources at all levels.</p>

          <img src="images/global-warming-burning-earth-burning.jpg" height="20" width="100">
          <p>Global warming is one of the biggest problems of this era. There have been countless solutions devised to slow down climate change. I have researched a method called Ocean fertilization. This method is the most effective and efficient method to slow down and prevent climate change. For decades climatologists across the world have been s tudying solutions to climate change. They are focusing too much on the land, however, and are not focusing enough on the Ocean which is around 70% of the Earthâ€™s surface. They also need to recognize that fish will be on the verge of extinction by 2048 according to multiple studies (Oceanos, 2017) and the phytoplankton population will have decreased by 40% in 60 years.</p>
